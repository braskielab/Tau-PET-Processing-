# Tau-PET-Processing-


This is the template script for Tau PET processing based off ADNI protocols. Use these scripts as a starting point for Tau PET analysis for other studies.

The petproc.config file is the file that needs to be updated on a study basis. This is where paths for files are located so make sure that it is set up properly before running the script. The scripts are labelled in the order that they need to be run. The weighted scripts are run after the other scripts are run. You must create a subject list, reference region, and ROI text file for script to run. Make sure paths are defined in petproc file.

If any of scripts need to be changed, please upload script with study name. Any lines that are removed should be commented out with the reason why. If any new commands are added, please comment why they were added.
